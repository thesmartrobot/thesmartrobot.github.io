<h2>Drone radar dataset</h2>

<p>This dataset contains camera and radar data from a drone flying in our lab.</p>

<video controls loop width="640">
  <source src="/video/dataset_drone.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>
  The dataset consists of recording sequences categorized in a number of scenarios, each contained in hd5 files.
  In each file contains a hdf5 dataset structure labeled by sensor (i.e. radar and camera and depth). 
  The radar is stored as raw ADC samples, and in addition we also provide post-processed range-doppler and range-azimuth maps.
  In addition, we also recorded the action commands (yaw, pitch, roll, thrust), and in scenarios where the motion capture
  system was active a ground truth 6DOF pose is provided.
  The data can be downloaded by following this

<h2>LatentSLAM dataset</h2>

<p>This dataset contains camera, lidar and radar data recorded with a turtlebot2i in our lab.</p>

<video controls loop width="640" height="271">
  <source src="/video/dataset_latentslam.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>
  The dataset consists of recording sequences categorized in 7 scenarios, each contained in hd5 files.
  In each file contains a hdf5 dataset structure labeled by sensor (lidar, radar and camera). Finally, 
  the taken action is stored under the action key. Each scenario consists of a different route
  through the warehouse. The data can be downloaded by following this
